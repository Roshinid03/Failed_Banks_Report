# Creating a Power BI Dashboard Using Failed Banks in US Dataset

## Introduction

In today's data-driven world, businesses rely heavily on visualizations to gain insights and make informed decisions. One powerful tool that helps in this process is Power BI. 
## Exploring the Failed Banks Dataset

To begin our project, we obtained a dataset of failed banks in the US. This dataset contained information such as the bank's name, city, state, date of closure, and the reason for closure. We imported the dataset into Excel and performed some data cleaning and transformations to ensure its usability in Power BI.

## Building the Power BI Dashboard

With the cleaned dataset in hand, we launched Power BI and started building our dashboard. We designed a visually appealing and user-friendly interface that presented the key information about failed banks clearly and concisely.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, our project involved creating a basic Power BI dashboard using a dataset of failed banks in the United States. By leveraging the power of Power BI, we were able to visualize and analyze the data in a meaningful way. This project demonstrated the effectiveness of Power BI in transforming raw data into actionable information, helping businesses make informed decisions based on visual analytics.
